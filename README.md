# conduit-app

The web interface for the Conduit streaming payments protocol. Create, manage, and monitor payment streams — all in a browser.

Built with [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) (App Router), [Stellar Wallets Kit](https://stellarwalletskit.dev), and Tailwind CSS. Design: **black and white only** — no accent colours.

## Pages

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | Landing page — protocol overview and call to action |
| `/about` | Protocol explainer — contract status, deployment info |
| `/streams` | Your streams dashboard — active, ended, and created |
| `/create` | Create a new stream — token, recipient, rate, duration |
| `/stream/[id]` | Single stream view — progress, withdraw, top-up, cancel |
| `/dashboard` | Sender overview — aggregate flow rate, total disbursed |

---

## Design Principles

- **Black and white only.** No colour utilities outside `text-black`, `text-white`, `bg-black`, `bg-white`, and the grey scale (`gray-*`). Contrast and hierarchy are achieved through weight, size, and spacing alone.
- **No rounded corners on primary containers.** Cards and panels use `rounded-none` or `rounded-sm`. Interactive elements (buttons, inputs) use `rounded`.
- **Monospaced numbers.** All amounts and timestamps use `font-mono tabular-nums`.
- **Dense layouts.** Information density over decoration.

## ⚠️ Wallet integration is stubbed

`contexts/WalletContext.tsx` does not talk to a real wallet yet:

- `connect()` sets a **hardcoded fake public key** and fake wallet name — it doesn't open
  Stellar Wallets Kit's modal or talk to Freighter/xBull/Albedo.
- `signTx()` doesn't sign anything — it logs the XDR and returns it **unsigned**.
- `@stellar/wallet-kit` isn't even in `package.json` yet; the real integration is written as a
  commented-out TODO block inside `connect()`.

Every mutating flow (withdraw, cancel, pause, top-up, create) will build and simulate a real
transaction against the configured RPC, but submission will fail once the network actually
verifies the signature — because there isn't one. Read-only flows (balances, stream lists) work
end-to-end today. Wiring up the real wallet kit (uncommenting and completing the TODO in
`WalletContext.tsx`) is the single biggest gap between this app and something demoable against
testnet with a real wallet.

Note: `/create` and `/stream/[id]` don't have separate form/detail components — the form logic
lives directly in `app/create/page.tsx`, and the detail page composes `StreamTimeline` +
`StreamActions` + `WithdrawButton` directly in `app/stream/[id]/page.tsx`.

## Contract Integration

`lib/soroban.ts` is the thin RPC layer — it builds, simulates, signs (via the connected wallet),
and submits transactions, and decodes raw `ScVal` results:

```typescript
// Mutating: builds → simulates → hands to the wallet to sign → submits → polls for the receipt
export async function invokeContract(
  source: string, contractId: string, method: string,
  args: xdr.ScVal[], signTx: (xdrBase64: string) => Promise<string>,
): Promise<string>   // returns the transaction hash

// Read-only: builds → simulates only, no signing or submission
export async function simulateReadOnly(
  source: string, contractId: string, method: string, args: xdr.ScVal[],
): Promise<xdr.ScVal>

export function scValToI128(val: xdr.ScVal): bigint
export function scValToU64(val: xdr.ScVal): bigint
```

`lib/factory.ts` and `lib/stream.ts` are per-contract wrappers built on top of those two
primitives — e.g. `stream.ts` exports `withdraw`, `cancel`, `pause`, `resume`, `topUp`,
`clawback`, `getWithdrawable`, and `getStreamInfo`, each encoding its own `ScVal` args and
calling `invokeContract`/`simulateReadOnly` with the right method name.

The RPC client itself (`lib/soroban.ts`'s `getServer()`) is a lazy singleton — these pages are
all client components, but Next still evaluates the module during static generation at build
time, before `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` is meaningful, so the client can't be constructed
eagerly at module scope.

Three DripStream functions — `forceCancel`, `transferRecipient`, `streamedTotal` — exist on the
contract but aren't wrapped in `lib/stream.ts` yet.

---

## RateTicker

The `RateTicker` component renders a live counter that increments in real time:

```tsx
<RateTicker
  ratePerSecond={stream.ratePerSecond}  // bigint, in stroops
  startBalance={stream.withdrawable}    // bigint, current withdrawable
/>
```

Every 100 ms it recalculates `withdrawable = storedWithdrawable + (now - lastFetch) * ratePerSecond` and displays the result. No contract call — pure arithmetic.

## Styling Rules (for contributors)

```
✓  text-black   text-white   text-gray-*
✓  bg-black     bg-white     bg-gray-*
✓  border-black border-white border-gray-*
✓  ring-black   ring-white   ring-gray-*

✗  text-blue-*  text-red-*  bg-indigo-*  (any hue-named colour)
✗  text-primary  bg-accent  (semantic aliases that resolve to colour)
```

The only exception is `text-green-600` and `text-red-600` for positive/negative balance deltas, and those must be wrapped in a `<span aria-label="...">` with a text fallback so colour is never the sole signal.
